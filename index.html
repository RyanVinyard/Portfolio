Below you will find a brief description of me, as well as my goals, experience, and other relevant information. If you would like to contact me, use the information or click the email link above.</span></p>
    <h3>About Me:</h3>
      <p> I am a double degree holding graduate of University of Oregon (Economics and Political Science). Currently I am continuing my education at <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/">Epicodus</a>, a Portland Oregon based coding school. I decided to enroll in a web and software coding program so that I could develop an in-demand, interesting skill to help complement and support my current skills. My goal is to find employment that will allow me to use my newfoud coding skills, and if possible, apply them to my knowledge of Economics.

      My goals at Epicodus are as follows:<p>
      <ol class="goals">
        <li>Gain sufficient coding knowledge to ease and <strong>accelerate</strong> my independent learning.</li>
        <li>Learn to use web/application coding to start <strong>my own projects.</strong></li>
        <li>Gain <strong>focused skills</strong> to be used for a future career.</li>
      </ol>
      <p> I'm not all talk! Find a list of my projects below. Click on the links to go to my github repository for each one. <em>I am still a new student at Epicodus<!--I'll update this! !-->, so these projects will only be improving.</em>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/vacation-site">Sample Vacation Webpage</a></p>
      <p>This webpage is for a vacation destination and shows my first forays into Bootstrap.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/wikipedia">Recreation of Wikipedia Homepage (in progress)</a></p>
      <p>This is a recreation of the homepage of Wikipedia. It shows my attempts at more advanced Bootstrap. It is nowhere near finished in its current state, however.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/Animal-Shelter">Sample Animal Shelter Webpage</a></p>
      <p>This is a completely tongue-in-cheek webpage to demonstrate floating.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/Island-Resort">And a suspiciously familiar sounding Island Resort Webpage</a>
      <p>This was one of my favorites. This one was made to demonstrate that I could adequately style using CSS.<p>
      <br>
      <p>...And for fun, you can track my progress by checking out my <a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/my-first-webpage.html">first webpage.</a> You know it's my first one because the directory is named "my-first-webpage<em>.html</em>."
