              I'm not all talk! Find a list of my projects below. Click on the links to go to my github repository for each one. <em>I am still a student at The Tech Academy, so these projects will only be improving.</em>

          <p>UNDER CONSTRUCTION: At the top here, I'll have the code snippets for my live project. It's my most important project. Stay tuned...</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/TTA-Csharp-Coding-Projects">TTA Csharp Coding Projects</a></p>
          <p>This is a running repository I have kept for The Tech Academy of my more complicated projects in Csharp, using Microsoft Visual studio. They should demonstrate that I have competancy using Visual Studio, Csharp, and SQL databases.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/trial-by-fire">ViaVitae</a></p>
          <p>This is an application I made in a 3 man team for the Hack for a Cause 2017 Hackathon in Eugene, Oregon. It is a reporting application which can mark reported crimes on a map and automatically send an email detailing the user input. It also stores entries in a database and allows a user to create an account. I primarily worked on this projects front end, writing the JavaScript, as well as most of the HTML, CSS, and a small portion of the PHP.</p>

          <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/epicodus-js-gamestores">Portland Game Store Locator</a></p>
          <p>This was an application I created in a two man team, used for locating local game stores in Portland, Oregon. It was an exercise in using the Google Maps API.</p>
          <hr />
          <p><a href="https://github.com/joannasaerom/civilwar2">Civil War 2</a></p>
          <p>This was our 5 person team's exercise in making an interactive game, as well as a first foray into the use of APIs. It is a fully playable, 2 player game in the style of Battleship.</p>
          <hr />
          <p><a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/taproom">Taproom Pipeline Exercise</a>
          <p>This was an exercise in good practice using pipelines. It is a functional webpage for keeping track of a bar's various taps.<p>

          <p>...And for fun, you can track my progress by checking out my <a href="https://github.com/RyanVinyard/my-first-webpage.html">first webpage.</a> You know it's my first one because the directory is named "my-first-webpage<em>.html</em>."
